C++ program that reads two integer numbers and outputs their sum, product, and quotient. Include a sensible input prompt and informative output. 


#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int n;
    int m;
    
    cin >> n;
    cin >> m;
    
    int sum = n + m;
    int pro = n * m;
    int quo = n / m;
    
    cout << "Sum of " << n << " and " << m << " is " << sum << endl;
    cout << "Product of " << n << " and " << m << " is " << pro << endl;
    cout << "Quotient of " << n << " and " << m << " is " << quo << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
